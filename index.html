    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Van Adams</strong>, a 28-year-old tech professional from <strong>South Georgia</strong> with several years of hands-on experience in IT support, field service, and hardware repair. 
      I‚Äôve worked in a variety of technical and customer-facing roles that strengthened my ability to solve problems quickly and deliver reliable solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background includes experience as an <strong>IT Field Technician</strong>, <strong>Data Migration Specialist</strong>, and <strong>Computer Hardware Technician</strong>, 
      handling everything from large-scale system migrations and Windows 365 deployments to hardware diagnostics, installations, and user support across multiple environments. 
      I‚Äôve also developed strong communication skills through roles at <strong>DIRECTV</strong>, <strong>Chick-fil-A</strong>, and <strong>Publix</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm currently expanding my knowledge in <strong>cloud computing</strong>, focusing on <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong>. 
      I‚Äôm passionate about continuous learning and pride myself on being able to catch on quickly, adapt to new technologies, and apply what I learn in real-world situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of tech, I enjoy <strong>producing music</strong>, spending time in <strong>nature</strong>, and exploring new ways to combine creativity with technology.
    </p>
